# Coding challenge

In this repo there is store-locations.csv

This is a tabluar dataset of the locations of every store of a major national retail chain.

# Deliverables

Fork the repo and write a script or application that, given a reasonably well-formed address string like:

1770 Union St, San Francisco, CA 94115

Returns the address of the geographically closest store from the dataset.

And write up a paragraph or two about how your solution works, and put it in this readme file.

# Notes

Feel free to do this in whatever language you would like, and focus on the problem itself; the way data gets input into the program is not important. Command line, GUI application, or even editing an obvious variable at the top of a file. Whatever. As long as it's reasonably easy for me to run your code and there are clear instructions for doing so.

You might need to use external APIs or services to get a working solution. That's fine. Also fine to make it work entirely offline.

If you do add cool polish, of course that will count for something, but *by far the most important thing is delivering working software that solves the problem of finding the closest location of this store*  .

I know which one is closest to my house, and the first thing I'll do is verify that it returns the address I expect.

I'm hoping this will take well under 2 hours; I did it in a language I know well and (with about 12 tabs open and tons of google searching) got a rough implementation working very quickly.

There are a ton of different ways to do this -- be creative!
