# Coding challenge

In this repo there is store-locations.csv

This is a tabular dataset of the locations of every store of a major national retail chain.

# Deliverables

Please download the file (rather than forking this repo), do the exercise, and then upload to your own repo.

Then, write a script or application that, given a reasonably well-formed address string like:

*"1770 Union St, San Francisco, CA 94123"*

Returns the address of the geographically closest store from the dataset.

Additionally:

- Please write up a paragraph or two about how your solution works, any assumptions you made, or caveats about your implementation, and put it in a readme file.
- Please write at **least one unit or integration test** that asserts something meaningful about the program. One good test is better than a bunch of mediocre tests.

Send me a github link to the final project.

# Notes

Feel free to do this in whatever language you would like, and focus on the problem itself; the way data gets input into the program is not important. Command line, GUI application, or even editing an obvious variable at the top of a file. Whatever. As long as it's reasonably easy for me to run your code and there are clear instructions for doing so.

You might need to use external APIs or services to get a working solution. That's fine. Also fine to make it work entirely offline. To the extent you need any algorithms, I'm not expecting you to reinvent anything from scratch, so use Google judiciously, as well as any libraries you find.

You can add polish if you'd like, but remember that software is about tradeoffs and *by far the most important thing is delivering working, practical software that solves the problem of finding the closest store location*. The goal is not to take up a bunch of your time, but see you solve a problem that looks very much like the type of work we do all the time.

There are a ton of different ways to skin this cat -- be smart, be practical, thanks, and good luck!
